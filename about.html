                I've been working with web design for about 4 months, since 
                I've started on the programme "Zealand - multimedia design
                and communication". 
                <br>
                <br>
                Since i began with the programme  i've worked
                in different groups, and i've made about 4 websites with
                these groups.
                2 of them were mobile first,  so i have experience in making
                websites which supports both pc and mobile format.
                <br>
                <br>
                I've also worked with target groups analytics - doing research
                and making interviews - to make the best choices in 
                the design process of making a website. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My favourite part of the design process though, is 
                working in adobe Xd - making wireframes and
                mockups for websites.

                I've been working in programs like sony vegas, 
                premiere pro and after effects for 5 years.
                For the first years mostly it's been about makin silly, 
                random videos, but for the last 2 years 
                i've been workin on more serious video projects 
                related to our electronic music act. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The themes/styles i'm most inspired by is
                Space, digital, liquid, abstract, retro technology and neon.
                These styles are used when i'm working with motion graphics.
                When you combine these with glitches, blur, very strong 
                colors and light effects, it makes for a great 
                visual to the electronic music scene.

                I've made electronic music for 10 years.
                Former project is called "ANX" - now "space rush"
                <br>
                <br>
                the theme of our new project is space and exploration.
                therefore we've made tracks that is futuristic, 
                emotional and full of energy, and we're always 
                aiming for a unique sound.
